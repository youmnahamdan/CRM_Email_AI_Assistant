### Sample Thread 3: Billing Dispute

**Customer Email:**
Subject: Incorrect Charge on My Invoice

Hi,

I noticed a charge of $150 labeled “administrative fee” on my latest invoice. I wasn’t informed of this fee when I renewed my policy. Could someone please clarify?

Regards,

Dear Mr. Al-Khatib,

I apologize for the confusion. The $150 fee is a one-time annual administrative charge introduced this year. It was mentioned in the renewal terms, but I understand it may have been overlooked. I’ve escalated your case to our Finance Department to review whether an adjustment can be made.

Warm regards,
