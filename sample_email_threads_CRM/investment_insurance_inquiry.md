Dear Ms. Darwish,

Yes, we offer several life insurance plans with investment-linked benefits. These plans allow you to build savings over time while enjoying life coverage. I've attached a brochure with plan details and historical return data. Would you like to schedule a call with one of our advisors to go over your options?
