Hello,

I currently hold a Standard Health Insurance Plan (Policy #HIP-2231). I’d like to know more about the Premium Plan and whether I’m eligible to upgrade mid-year.

Dear Mr. Khalil,

Thank you for your interest in upgrading your coverage. You are eligible to upgrade to the Premium Plan at any time. I’ve attached a brochure comparing both plans. If you wish to proceed, just reply to this email, and we’ll send the upgrade form.

Sincerely,
